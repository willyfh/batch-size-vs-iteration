# The Relationship of Batch Size and Number of Iterations
This small experiment attempts to address the following questions:

1) Do we need to increase the number of epochs, i.e., fix the number of iterations, as we increase the batch size?
2) Or do we need to fix the number of epochs, i.e., decrease the number of iterations, as we increase the batch size?

Note: While other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, may also impact the results, I maintain consistent values for these parameters across all experiments.
